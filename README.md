# RecordShop Frontend

This project provides a minimal frontend for the [RecordShop backend web API project](https://github.com/rsdc2/cs-record-shop).

## Run and test in Visual Studio (2022)

Load `RecordShop.sln` in Visual Studio, from where the project can be run and tested using Visual Studio's user interface.

## Running from the commandline

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. `cd` into the repo folder:

```
cd cs-record-shop
```

3. `cd` into the `RecordShop` project.

```
cd RecordShop
```

4. Run the project:

```
dotnet run
```

This will build and run the project. Among the messages that appear in the console will be one providing the address on which the server is listening, e.g.:

```
info:   Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
        Now listening on: http://localhost:<PORT> 

```

where `<PORT>` stands for a four digit port number, that will be needed for subsequent steps.

### Accessing in a browser 

5. In a browser, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/Albums
```

This will display a list of albums in the database. Using the browser alone it will only be possible to _access_ data in the database: it will not be possible to _modify_ the data.

### Accessing via the Swagger interface

5. In a browser, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/swagger/index.html
```

This will provide the possibility of submitting the full range of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests. 

## Run the tests from the commandline

1. `cd` into the tests folder in the repo:

```
cd cs-record-shop/RecordShop_Tests
```

2. Run the tests with:

```
dotnet test
```
